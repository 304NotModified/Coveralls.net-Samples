Coveralls.net Samples
=====================

These are sample configurations for using [coveralls.net](https://github.com/csmacnz/Coveralls.net) with different CI and coverage tools. Each branch is a unique scenario combination of test framework, coverage tool and coveralls.net publishing the results to [coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/).

This is still a work in progress so the samples are not complete yet.

### Sample Application Branch ###
[![Appveyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/v4m661b28npr789g/branch/sample-application?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/MarkClearwater/coveralls-net-samples/branch/sample-application)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csmacnz/Coveralls.net-Samples.svg?branch=sample-application)](https://travis-ci.org/csmacnz/Coveralls.net-Samples)

This branch represents the base application, so I can branch off of this with different build configurations and see how these are reported in different CI builds, coverage runners, and coveralls.io.
